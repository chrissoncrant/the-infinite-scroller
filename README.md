# The Infinite Scroller

## Reality
This is an infinite scroller of photos. 

From my local repo it fetches new photos from Unsplash after scrolling passed a certain point in the window. 

From GitHub, due to security purposes related to the API key it will infinitely cycle through a static array of photos that were previously fetched from Unsplash.
