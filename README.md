# The Infinite Scroller

## Reality
Okay so this is an infinite scroller when I run this from my local repo. If you access this via GitPages, well, it is not so infinite. 

What GitPages is accessing is a number of URLs that I have stored, but you will meet an end to the scrolling faster than I will when I open this from my local machine.

The reason this is so is because of the API key. I do not want to push that secret to the public repo as this would violate the terms of the API being accessed. 

I have searched how to hide the API key, but have not found a way without creating a backend that serves it. 

Doing so would be a fun challenge and I believe I do have the knowledge of Node.js to do so, but that is not the purpose of this project.
